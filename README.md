# ML-Project-SVG

This is a sample project experimented by me to get better understanding of Simple Vector Machine Algorithm.

The dataset contains different sizes and proportions of ricegrain.With the help of the given information, I have predicted which group does the ricegrain belong to.

In the hope of doing more projects soon.Thank you.
